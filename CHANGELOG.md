and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.5] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed

- **Binary corruption in releases** - Wrap binaries in platform-appropriate archives to preserve file permissions and prevent corruption through GitHub Actions artifact system
- **Executable permissions lost** - Fixed issue where Unix binaries lost +x permission during artifact upload/download
- **SHA256 mismatch** - Generate checksums at build time and verify after extraction to ensure binary integrity
- **Cache conflicts** - Use unique cache keys per target to prevent 409 conflicts in parallel builds
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Use native tools on each platform (PowerShell on Windows, bash on Unix)

### Added

- **Individual SHA256 files** - Each binary now has a corresponding .sha256 file generated at build time
- **Combined SHA256SUMS** - All binaries included in a single SHA256SUMS file in releases for easy verification
- **Checksum verification** - Automated verification step that checksums match after artifact extraction
- **Build-time checksums** - SHA256 printed during build for traceability
- **Platform-specific packaging** - Unix binaries distributed as .tar.gz, Windows binaries as .zip

### Changed

- **Updated GitHub Actions** - Upgraded all actions to latest major versions for automatic updates and security

 ### Technical

- Unix: tar.gz archives preserve executable permissions through artifact system
- Windows: zip archives created with PowerShell's Compress-Archive
- Unix: SHA256 generated with sha256sum, Windows: Get-FileHash cmdlet
- Cache keys now include both target and Cargo.lock hash
- Comprehensive logging at each stage (build, extract, verify)
- Release extraction handles both tar.gz and zip formats

## [0.1.4] - 2025-11-09

### Changed

- Version bump for development

## [0.1.3] - 2025-11-08

### Added

- **Shell tab completions** - Native dynamic completions for bash, zsh, and fish shells
- **Intelligent file filtering** - Tab completion intelligently filters to only show `.md` and `.markdown` files
- **Interactive setup helper** - `--setup-completions` flag to auto-detect shell and configure completion with one command
- **Auto shell detection** - Automatically detects bash, zsh, or fish and locates shell config files
- **Enhanced help system** - Comprehensive `--help` menu with detailed descriptions, examples, and usage patterns
- **Setup instructions** - Clear instructions for manual completion setup if automated setup is declined

### Changed

- **Feature enablement** - `unstable-dynamic` feature now enabled by default for seamless completion experience
- **Help documentation** - All CLI options now have detailed descriptions with inline examples

### Technical

- Integrated `clap_complete 4.5.60` with `unstable-dynamic` feature flag
- Implemented `CompleteEnv` for runtime completion generation
- Created custom `ArgValueCandidates` for markdown file filtering
- Added interactive setup module with shell detection (`src/cli/setup.rs`)

## [0.1.2] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

- **Content display robustness** - Fixed critical bugs where content would disappear or show incorrect sections after navigation and collapse/expand operations
- **Selection preservation** - Selection now correctly preserved by heading text instead of index during collapse/expand operations
- **Content scroll reset** - Content scroll now properly resets to top when navigating between different sections
- **Dynamic content height** - Content height and scrollbar now correctly update based on the currently selected section
- **Collapse parent behavior** - Collapsing a parent heading now correctly selects the parent instead of an arbitrary item
- **Search filter preservation** - Search filtering now maintains the current selection when possible instead of always jumping to first item
- **Bookmark stability** - Bookmarks now store heading text instead of indices, remaining valid after collapse operations

### Technical

- Added `select_by_text()` helper method for robust text-based selection
- Added `update_content_metrics()` to synchronize content height and scroll state
- Added `previous_selection` tracking to detect selection changes
- Changed bookmark storage from `Option<usize>` to `Option<String>`
