- **Help popup infinite scroll** - Prevented scrolling past the end of help content ([PR #11](https://github.com/Epistates/treemd/pull/11))

- **Numbered lists with nested code blocks** - Fixed markdown display issue where numbered list items containing code blocks would render incorrectly ([#8](https://github.com/Epistates/treemd/issues/8))
  - List items now properly contain their nested code blocks, blockquotes, and other block elements
  - Parser correctly associates indented blocks with their parent list items
  - Renderer handles nested block rendering within list item context

- **Interactive mode toggle** - Pressing `i` now correctly toggles out of interactive mode (previously only entered it)

### Changed

- **Link navigator layout stability** - Link targets now display inline to prevent layout shift when cycling through links ([PR #9](https://github.com/Epistates/treemd/pull/9))
  - Previously, selected links showed target on a separate line causing list to jump
  - Now all links show target inline (e.g., `[1] Link Text → target`) for stable navigation

### Refactored

- **Help text module** - Extracted help text content into dedicated `src/tui/help_text.rs` module ([PR #11](https://github.com/Epistates/treemd/pull/11))

  - `ui/table.rs` (~460 lines) - Table rendering: `render_table`, `render_table_row`, `TableRenderContext`
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for extracted modules (29 new tests)
  - Zero regressions - all 90 tests pass

### Technical

  - Added `Block::Heading` variant with level, content, and inline elements for sub-heading support
  - Added `Block::ListItemStart` variant to track list item context during parsing
  - `parse_content()` now parses headings within content and creates `Block::Heading` blocks
  - Nested blocks are properly associated with their parent list items instead of being siblings

  - Each module has focused responsibility and comprehensive test coverage
  - Added `ContentBlock::Heading` rendering with level-appropriate colors and styling
  - `render_inline_elements()` now accepts optional selection index for inline element highlighting
  - Links and images in interactive mode get background highlight when selected
  - Improved code discoverability and maintainability

## [0.4.1] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- **Config file `color_mode` setting ignored** - The `color_mode` setting in `config.toml` is now properly respected ([#5](https://github.com/Epistates/treemd/issues/5))
  - Priority order: CLI flags > config file > auto-detection
  - Set `color_mode = "rgb"` or `color_mode = "256"` in config to override auto-detection
  - `color_mode = "auto"` (default) uses improved auto-detection

- **RGB auto-detection fails for truecolor terminals** - Improved terminal color detection for Kitty, Alacritty, WezTerm, and other RGB-capable terminals ([#5](https://github.com/Epistates/treemd/issues/5))
  - Now checks `COLORTERM` environment variable for `truecolor` or `24bit` (primary standard per [termstandard/colors](https://github.com/termstandard/colors))
  - Checks `TERM` for known truecolor terminals (`kitty`, `alacritty`, `wezterm`) and suffixes (`-truecolor`, `-direct`)
  - Checks `TERM_PROGRAM` for known apps (iTerm, Kitty, VS Code, Hyper, etc.)
  - Falls back to `supports_color` crate detection

### Technical

- **Enhanced color detection** (`src/tui/terminal_compat.rs`)
  - New `detect_truecolor_support()` method with multi-method detection
  - Environment variable checks before crate-based detection
  - Better compatibility with terminals that set `COLORTERM=truecolor`

- **Config priority in main** (`src/main.rs`)
  - Color mode selection now checks config file before auto-detection
  - Clear priority: CLI args (highest) > config file > auto-detection (lowest)
